A 1985 graduate of Princeton University, she worked for four years as an engineer in the electric power industry before getting her PhD in electrical engineering in 1994 at the University of Maryland. Her formal training is in control theory, a field in which mathematical foundations and tools are developed and applied to modeling, analyzing and synthesizing systems with behavior that can be governed, typically by feedback. In 2004 she was awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship as a marine roboticist. Feedback is ubiquitous in nature as well as in the engineered world. It refers to responsive behavior; the system repeatedly 1) measures how it is behaving and compares this to some reference or desired behavior, 2) computes a corrective action and 3) effects the desired change. Most recently Leonard's work focuses on the feedback and dynamics of collective motion. Working with ecologists and evolutionary biologists, she studies feedback mechanisms and dynamics in animal groups. In parallel she designs the means to enable groups of autonomous mobile robots to move in organized, coordinated patterns. Leonard co-leads an ambitious, collaborative project called Adaptive (Ocean) Sensing and Prediction (ASAP) which features a fleet of underwater robotic gliders equipped with sensors to measure the temperature and currents in the ocean and controlled to move as a group into patterns that yield the richest data set."

After a year as a Kennedy Scholar at MIT and two years in the defence electronics industry, he studied for a doctorate at the University of Edinburgh which was awarded in 1983. Until 1987 he was on the faculty of the department of Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh and a Royal Society Research Fellow. From 1987 to 1999, he has been on the faculty of the Department of Engineering Science in the University of Oxford, where he ran the Visual Dynamics Research Group, became a Professor in 1996, and was a Royal Society Senior Research Fellow for 1998\u20139. In 1999 he moved to Microsoft Research Cambridge to lead the Vision Group. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1998, and Fellow of the Royal Society in 2005. In 2006 the Royal Academy of Engineering awarded him its Silver Medal and in 2007 the Institution of Engineering and Technology presented him with the Mountbatten Medal. He has published several books including \u201cVisual Reconstruction\u201d with A. Zisserman (MIT press), \u201cActive Vision\u201d with A. Yuille (MIT Press) and \u201cActive Contours\u201d with M. Isard (Springer-Verlag). He has twice won the prize of the European Conference on Computer Vision, with R. Cipolla in 1992 and with M. Isard in 1996, and was awarded the IEEE David Marr Prize (jointly with K. Toyama) in 2001. He has served as program chairman for the International Conference on Computer Vision in 1995 and 1999, and is on the editorial boards of the journals \u201cImage and Vision Computing\u201d, the \u201cInternational Journal of Computer Vision\u201d and \u201cComputer Vision and Image Understanding\u201d.
